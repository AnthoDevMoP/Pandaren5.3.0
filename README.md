Pandaren5.3.0
=============

World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria emulator for 5.3.0 (17128)

READ ME :

TO DO find opcodes:
SMSG_UPDATE_ACCOUNT_DATA_COMPLETE
SMSG_MOVE_SET_ACTIVE_MOVER
CMSG_MOVE_SET_ACTIVE_MOVER

Search what opcode is this : 0x059B

Fixed SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT (needed things)

For those who fork it.

1. There are 2 updates for "auth" that needs to be executed (don't forget about them).
2. I hope people will push something not only pull and wait for other.
